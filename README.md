# Solutions for Google Code Jam 2018
This is my first time competing on Google Code Jam. I really love the format of problems so far, and I think I will be back again next year!

Link to [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) web site.

## Qualification round
Solutions for the problems except for the "Go, Gopher!" are in the QualificationRound directory.

I had RTE - run-time error on Go, Gopher!, probably because it's a new type of problem and I skipped practice session.

EDIT: After reading [analysis](https://codejam.withgoogle.com/2018/challenges/00000000000000cb/analysis) I realised I actually had a good strategy for "Go, Gopher!" I only placed my fixed size rectange 4x5 to start from (0,0) instead of from (1,1) which caused RTE inside of the judge system software. I will post the solution for "Go, Gopher!" soon enough.

As soon as I find time I will also write small Editorials here.
