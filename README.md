# Solutions for Google Code Jam 2018
This is my first time competing on Google Code Jam. I really love the format of problems so far, and I think I will be back again next year!

Link to [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) web site.

## Qualification round
Solutions for the problems except for the "Go, Gopher!" are in the QualificationRound directory.

(I had RTE - run-time error, probably because it's a new type of problem and I skipped practice session)

As soon as I find time I will write small Editorials here.
